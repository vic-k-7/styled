This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Style Dictionary

This project requires style-dictionary to be installed globally

`npm install -g style-dictionary`

This example code is bare-bones to show you what this framework can do. If you have the style-dictionary module installed globally, you can `cd` into this directory and run:
```bash
style-dictionary build
```

You should see something like this output:
```
Copying starter files...

Source style dictionary starter files created!

Running `style-dictionary build` for the first time to generate build artifacts.


scss
✔︎  build/scss/_variables.scss

android
✔︎  build/android/font_dimens.xml
✔︎  build/android/colors.xml

ios
✔︎  build/ios/StyleDictionaryColor.h
✔︎  build/ios/StyleDictionaryColor.m
✔︎  build/ios/StyleDictionarySize.h
✔︎  build/ios/StyleDictionarySize.m

ios-swift

ios-swift-separate-enums
✔︎  build/ios-swift/StyleDictionaryColor.swift
✔︎  build/ios-swift/StyleDictionarySize.swift
```

Pat yourself on the back, you have now built your first style dictionary! Moving on, take a look at what we have built. This should have created a build directory and it should look like this:
```
├── README.md
├── config.json
├── properties/
│   ├── color/
│       ├── base.json
│       ├── font.json
│   ├── size/
│       ├── font.json
├── build/
│   ├── android/
│      ├── font_dimens.xml
│      ├── colors.xml
│   ├── scss/
│      ├── _variables.scss
│   ├── ios/
│      ├── StyleDictionaryColor.h
│      ├── StyleDictionaryColor.m
│      ├── StyleDictionarySize.h
│      ├── StyleDictionarySize.m
│   ├── ios-swift/
│      ├── StyleDictionary.swift
│      ├── StyleDictionaryColor.swift
│      ├── StyleDictionarySize.swift
```

If you open `config.json` you will see there are 3 platforms defined: scss, android, ios. Each platform has a transformGroup, buildPath, and files. The buildPath and files of the platform should match up to the files what were built. The files built should look like these:

**Android**
```xml
<!-- font_dimens.xml -->
<resources>
  <dimen name="size_font_small">12.00sp</dimen>
  <dimen name="size_font_medium">16.00sp</dimen>
  <dimen name="size_font_large">32.00sp</dimen>
  <dimen name="size_font_base">16.00sp</dimen>
</resources>

<!-- colors.xml -->
<resources>
  <color name="color_base_gray_light">#ffcccccc</color>
  <color name="color_base_gray_medium">#ff999999</color>
  <color name="color_base_gray_dark">#ff111111</color>
  <color name="color_base_red">#ffff0000</color>
  <color name="color_base_green">#ff00ff00</color>
  <color name="color_font_base">#ffff0000</color>
  <color name="color_font_secondary">#ff00ff00</color>
  <color name="color_font_tertiary">#ffcccccc</color>
</resources>
```

**SCSS**
```scss
// variables.scss
$color-base-gray-light: #cccccc;
$color-base-gray-medium: #999999;
$color-base-gray-dark: #111111;
$color-base-red: #ff0000;
$color-base-green: #00ff00;
$color-font-base: #ff0000;
$color-font-secondary: #00ff00;
$color-font-tertiary: #cccccc;
$size-font-small: 0.75rem;
$size-font-medium: 1rem;
$size-font-large: 2rem;
$size-font-base: 1rem;
```

**iOS**
```objc
#import "StyleDictionaryColor.h"

@implementation StyleDictionaryColor

+ (UIColor *)color:(StyleDictionaryColorName)colorEnum{
  return [[self values] objectAtIndex:colorEnum];
}

+ (NSArray *)values {
  static NSArray* colorArray;
  static dispatch_once_t onceToken;

  dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{
    colorArray = @[
[UIColor colorWithRed:0.800f green:0.800f blue:0.800f alpha:1.000f],
[UIColor colorWithRed:0.600f green:0.600f blue:0.600f alpha:1.000f],
[UIColor colorWithRed:0.067f green:0.067f blue:0.067f alpha:1.000f],
[UIColor colorWithRed:1.000f green:0.000f blue:0.000f alpha:1.000f],
[UIColor colorWithRed:0.000f green:1.000f blue:0.000f alpha:1.000f],
[UIColor colorWithRed:1.000f green:0.000f blue:0.000f alpha:1.000f],
[UIColor colorWithRed:0.000f green:1.000f blue:0.000f alpha:1.000f],
[UIColor colorWithRed:0.800f green:0.800f blue:0.800f alpha:1.000f]
    ];
  });

  return colorArray;
}

@end
```

Pretty nifty! This shows a few things happening:
1. The build system does a deep merge of all the property JSON files defined in the `source` attribute of `config.json`. This allows you to split up the property JSON files however you want. There are 2 JSON files with `color` as the top level key, but they get merged properly.
1. The build system resolves references to other style properties. `{size.font.medium.value}` gets resolved properly.
1. The build system handles references to property values in other files as well as you can see in `properties/color/font.json`.

Now let's make a change and see how that affects things. Open up `properties/color/base.json` and change `"#111111"` to `"#000000"`. After you make that change, save the file and re-run the build command `style-dictionary build`. Open up the build files and take a look.

**Huzzah!**

Now go forth and create! Take a look at all the built-in [transforms](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/transforms?id=pre-defined-transforms) and [formats](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/formats?id=pre-defined-formats).
